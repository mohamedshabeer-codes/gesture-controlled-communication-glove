# Gesture Controlled Communication Glove 🧤 

## 📝 Project Description
A wearable glove that converts hand gestures into speech using Arduino and sensors to help **speech-impaired individuals** communicate easily and effectively.  
This project bridges the communication gap by translating physical gestures into audio output through a speaker module.

---

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 3 × Flex Sensors (for finger bend detection)
- 3 × 10 kΩ resistors
- DFPlayer Mini (MP3 Sound Module)  
- Speaker (8Ω, 2W)  
- LCD Display I2C (16x2)  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

---

## 🧩 Working Principle
1. Flex sensors detect finger bending and send analog signals to the Arduino.  
2. Each gesture is assigned a specific voice message.  
3. The DFPlayer Mini plays the pre-recorded audio output.  
4. The LCD displays the recognized gesture text.
